# everythingyourself
A open source way of doing ElfYourself 

I basically try to have a library where one can input a video, coordinates and a image of a face.  
The output should then be a video with the face moving/disappearing properly.

For now I only prepare everything in a jupyter notebok (prep_heroyourself.ipynb), to have an overview of the possibilities.
As soon as I will be ready, I will port it to a web-backend (Django or something). 

The next thing I plan will be a Webapp in which you can import your video and easily skip through the frames to map the coordinates. It should be as easy as possible (like, simply clicking where the face should go.)
